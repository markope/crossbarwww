The Arduino Yun is a Linux computer + microcontroller with built-in wifi which runs OpenWRT.

* We have a more detailed [overview](Arduino-Yun-Overview) of the Yun and its features:
* There are instructions for [basic setup](Arduino-Yun-Basic-Setup) and [extending the disk space](Arduino-Yun-Expanding-Disk-Space)

## Generic Control of GPIO

* [yun-gpio-to-wamp] gives access to the GPIO pins on the Arduino Yun. Each pin has a pre-set associated endpoint. Requires [extending the disk space](Arduino-Yun-Expanding-Disk-Space)
