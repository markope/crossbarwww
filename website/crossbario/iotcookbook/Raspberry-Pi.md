The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a family of small computers which all feature ethernet, USB and HDMI connections and run Linux (among other options).

Because of its popularity, there are plenty of tutorials for installation and setup, e.g. [the official one](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/).

The Pi generally has enough processing power and memory to run standard Linux software (albeit often slowly). Getting WAMP up and running should usually be equally easy as on a desktop Linux system. Specifics are described as part of the component documentation.
