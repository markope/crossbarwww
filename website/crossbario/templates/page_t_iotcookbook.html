            You want to solve a problem -
         </p>
         <p class="solution">
            we offer components & recipes to build your solutions
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               All components come with <strong>built-in connectivity</strong>. They can connect from anywhere,  and you can easily  build distributed applications.
            </li>
            <li>
               All components can <strong>communicate freely with each other</strong> - including calling procedures. The compoments connect via a Crossbar.io application router. Client libraries for WAMP, the protocol used, are available for 9 languages (and growing). You can also integrate services with REST APIs, so your applications can talk to pretty much anything on the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
               All recipes include <strong>step-by-step instructions</strong> to get things working. Just follow the instructions - no need to worry about the technological background details. If you want to dive deeper into the technology, we provide links to get your started.
            </li>
            <li>
               The software used in these recipes is <strong>open source</strong>, and part of a growing ecosystem aorund the WAMP protocol.
            </li>
            <li>
               A <strong>variety of microcontrollers</strong>     , including the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Yun, are used as part of components.
            </li>

            Getting a WAMP router
         </h2>

         <p>
            There are three main ways to gettin a WAMP router
         </p>

         <ul>
            <li>
               We offer a demo instance for testing and light development workloads.
            </li>
            <li>
               You can quickly spin up a virtual machine with Crossbar.io preinstalled. We suggest Microsoft Azure, but Amazon EC2 also works.
            </li>
            <li>
               You can install Crossbar.io yourself - locally or in the cloud.
            </li>
