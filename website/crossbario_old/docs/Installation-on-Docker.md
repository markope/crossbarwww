This outlines one way to get the Crossbar.io "hello world" application
running inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.


## Overview

We will build a container called "crossbar" based on Debian that will
have the default "hello world" Crossbar demonstration and run it,
passing through port 8080 so that a Web browser on the host can visit
the demo.


## Create The Container

Create an empty directory (for example, `~/crossbar-hello`) into which
to place the following text as  `~/crossbar-hello/Dockerfile`:

```sh
# to build this container:
# docker build -t crossbar .
FROM debian:jessie

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libreadline-dev libbz2-dev libsqlite3-dev libncurses5-dev python-pip python-dev
RUN pip install crossbar[all]

# This creates the default "hello world" application.
RUN crossbar init --template hello:python --appdir /hello

# You need to forward port 8080 with "-p 8080" on the command-line:
# docker run -p 8080 crossbar
ENTRYPOINT ["crossbar", "start", "--cbdir", "/hello/.crossbar"]
```

Next, we need to build the Docker container, which we will tag with
the name "crossbar". The first time might take a little while, as
docker will download the base Debian jessie image.

```console
docker build -t crossbar ~/crossbar-hello
```

This should eventually output a final line like `Successfully built
9029429fc7cb``.


## Running the Container

We need to tell Docker to forward port 8080 through to the host and
run our container.

```console
docker run -d -p 8080 crossbar
```

This will print out an SHA hash, which is the ID of the
container. Alternatively, you can capture the container ID in an
environment variable if you're running on Linux or OS X:

```console
export CONTAINER_ID=`docker run -d -p 8080 crossbar`
```

Now, we use the container ID to figure out the IP address that Docker
assigned to the running container:

```console
docker inspect $CONTAINER_ID | grep IPAddress
```

(Replace $CONTAINER_ID above with whatever docker printed out in the previous
step). This should print out something like:

```console
        "IPAddress": "172.17.0.47",
```


## Visit the Demo in a Browser

In your favourite browser, visit the above IP address at port 8080,
like `http://172.17.0.47:8080` and you should see a Web page with
title "Hello WAMP". Note that the IP address you receive will likely
be different from the above example.


## Shut Down the Container

When you're done, you need to kill off the container:

```console
docker kill $CONTAINER_ID
```

Again, replace `$CONTAINER_ID` with the actual container ID.
