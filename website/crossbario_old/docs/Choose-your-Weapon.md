Crossbar.io enables polyglot frontends and backends. Since all traffic is handled via WAMP, the implementation language of a component is transparent to other components.

You're free to choose your language as it best suits you.

Crossbar.io contains templates that allow you to get started quickly by creating fully-functioning basic apps for some languages. These can serve as the basis for adding your own functionality without having to worry about boilerplate code.
