# Quick Setup

From a terminal, run the following to setup the Crossbar.io Oracle database integration:

```
cd database
sqlplus sys/oracle@localhost:1521/orcl as sysdba @create_users.sql
sqlplus cbdb/crossbar@localhost:1521/orcl @install.sql
```

> Note: Above assumes Oracle database is listening on `localhost` port `1521` using the service name `ORCL`, and that `SYS` still has the default password `oracle`.

Then start Crossbar.io

```
crossbar start
```

# Installation

By default, the installation scripts generated will create two database users:

* `CBADAPTER`
* `CBDB`

The `CBADAPTER` user is used by Crossbar.io to connect to Oracle. Other than `CREATE SESSION`, this user only has `EXECUTE` permission on the public API (the stored procedures) exposed by the Crossbar.io database integration.

The `CBDB` user is the owning schema of the database objects making up the Crossbar.io database integration.

To create those user, you must be connected as `SYS` and run the following script (from within the `database` directory generated):

```console
$ sqlplus sys/oracle@localhost:1521/orcl as sysdba @create_users.sql

The next step creates all the database objects that together make up the Crossbar.io database integration.

To create those objects, you must be connected as `CBDB` and run the following script (from within the `database` directory generated):

```console
$ sqlplus cbdb/crossbar@localhost:1521/orcl @install.sql
