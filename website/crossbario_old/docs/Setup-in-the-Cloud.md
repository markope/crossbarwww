If you want to run your own Crossbar.io instance in the cloud, probably the easiest way is to use an Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider like [Microsoft Azure](azure.microsoft.com/) or [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

Crossbar.io runs great on these services, you can choose the right virtual machine hardware for your application and have full control over the complete system and your data.

We've created VM images with preinstalled Crossbar.io running on Linux and step-by-step guides to get you started in essentially minutes:
