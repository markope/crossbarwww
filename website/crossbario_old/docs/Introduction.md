# Underlying concepts

**Crossbar**.io is an open source **unified application router** implementing the **WAMP protocol**, an open standard WebSocket subprotocol which enables **loosely coupled** application components/microservices to communicate in (soft) **real-time**. 

**Crossbar**.io directes and transmitts **messages** between these components, which are written with WAMP client libraries, existing for **multiple languages** (currently 8). Every application component can be written in any of these, and you can mix components written in multiple languages since all interaction is via WAMP. 

With **Crossbar**.io as a router, you can create applications which are **cross-platform**, and distribute the functionality in your applications as you want. This enables application architectures such as

The WAMP protocol offers **two messaging patterns** to allow components communicate:

* **Routed Remote Procedure Calls** (RPCs) - components register procedures and any other component can call this via Crossbar.io, with Crossbario handling the registrations, call and result routing.
* **Publish & Subscribe** (PubSub) - components subscribe to topics and publish to these, with Crossbar.io handling the subscriptions and dispatching.

# Features

**Crossbar**.io is not just a WAMP router - it also provides and manages infrastructure for your application.

Features include:

* **Integrated Static Web Server** - serve your HTML5 frontends directly from Crossbar.io
* **Component Hosting** - start application components in any language together with Crossbar.io + manage their lifecycle
* **Authentication** and **Authorization** configurable in Crossbar.io
* hosting **WSGI** applications
* **HTTP Push Bridge** for integration with legacy applications

This will often make Crossbar.io all the infrastructure you need besides your database.

**Crossbar**.io is is high-performant, scalable, robust and secure, and distributed as Open Source under the AGPL v3 license.

It is Python software and runs on *nix, Windows and Mac OSX.
