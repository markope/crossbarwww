The Raspberry Pi Camera component allows the remote triggering of a photo via a WAMP procedure call. The photo is returned as the call result. 

<div class="topimage_container">
   <img class="topimage" src="../../static/img/iotcookbook/camera_raspberry_pi.jpg" alt="">   
</div>

## Trying it out

The code for this can be found in the [crossbarexamples GitHub repository](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbarexamples) under `iotcookbook`. You need to clone this (or [download it as a ZIP file](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbarexamples/archive/master.zip)).

The Pi should support most standard WebCams once you've done

```shell
sudo apt-get install fswebcam
```

To try it whether this works, do

```shell
fswebcam image.jpg
```

and then open the image.

Then open a shell for the component directory on your computer. 

Start up Crossbar.io:

```shell
crossbar start
```

This also serves a frontend which allows you to trigger the taking of an image and displays the progress feedback as well as the image:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

In `camera_pi.js`, add the URL of the machine on which Crossbar.io runs:

```javascript
var connection = new autobahn.Connection({
   url: "ws://<URL OF YOUR CROSSBAR INSTANCE>/ws", // replace with the url of your crossbar instance
   realm: "iot_cookbook"
});
```

Then get `camera_pi.js` onto the Raspberry Pi, e.g. by doing

```console
scp camera_pi.js pi@<IP of your Pi>:~/
```

`camera_pi.js` is run using Node.js, so you need this installed, and additionally npm, Node.js's package managenment, and Autobahn|JS. Once you've got Node.js and npm, in the directory where `camera_pi.js`is, do

```shell
npm install autobahn
```

(In case you get a certificate error, doing 
```shell
npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
```
is one way to solve this, though you now no longer use https!)

We also need `uuencode`, which we install by doing

```shell
sudo apt-get install sharutils
```

Now run our camera component using Node.js

```shell
nodejs camera_pi.js
```

This should log

```shell
Raspberry Pi Camera starting
connected
Procedure 'io.crossbar.examples.pi.camera.take_photo' registered: 1902454329
```

Once this is running, in the browser frontend click on `take photo`. The default image of a burglar should be replaced with an image of whatever is in front of your webcam.

## The API

The component exposes a single procedure

```
io.crossbar.examples.pi.camera.take_photo
```

The result is a base64 encoded image. As a default this is JPG, but can be changed (in 'camera_pi.js', see the [fswebcam documentation](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/fswebcam.1.html)). Due to the encoding using 'uuencode' on the Pi, header & footer need to be removed before this can be used in a data URI.

## Using it

In your own project:


* Adapt the procedure URL for taking a photo to your own needs.
